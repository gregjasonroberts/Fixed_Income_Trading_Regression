<p>The following project is an example of an analysis that I performed for work on behalf of a request from the CFO of my organization.   I was tasked with running a regression analysis on the average trading volumes for US Treasuries and understand the correlations with internal fixed income trading revenues.  We also looked at the MOVE Index (Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate) to analyze that correlation as well.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the revenues in this business unit gets generated from the processing of client trading activity. in US treasury securities. Suffice to say, the ability to forecast revenues is integral to management's guidance to Wall Street and thus it's performance and limiting earnings volatility.  </p>
